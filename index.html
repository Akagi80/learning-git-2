    <h1 class="title test">Johnny B. Goode</h1>
    <h3 class="author">by Chuck Berry</h3>
    <p class="verse">Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans<br>
        Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
        There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
        Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
        Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
        But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell</p>
    <p class="chorus">Go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Johnny B. Goode</p>
    <p class="verse">He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
        Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
        Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade<br>
        Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
        The people passing by they would stop and say<br>
        "Oh my what that little country boy could play"</p>
    <p class="chorus">Go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Go Johnny go go<br>
        Johnny B. Goode</p>
    <p class="verse">His mother told him "someday you will be a man<br>
        And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
        Many people coming from miles around<br>
        To hear you play your music when the sun go down<br>
        Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
        Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"</p>
    <p class="chorus">Go go<br>
        Go Johnny go<br>
        Go go go Johnny go<br>
        Go go go Johnny go<br>
        Go go go Johnny gov
        Go<br>
        Johnny B. Goode</p>
